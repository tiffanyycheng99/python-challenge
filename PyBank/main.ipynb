    "* In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)\n",

    "* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:\n",

    "  * The total number of months included in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The net total amount of \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Calculate the changes in \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:\n",
